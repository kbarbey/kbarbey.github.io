## Resources

Here are some resources about EPFL that could be useful for students. I've used extensively other older students' resources and now it's my turn to return the favour. I hope you find them useful! Of course, no guarantee on the quality ;)

## About Me
I'm a master student in Astrophysics at EPFL. I love cycling, climbing, sailing and more generally exploring the outdoors. I have close to zero talent in these activities but I enjoy them nonetheless.
